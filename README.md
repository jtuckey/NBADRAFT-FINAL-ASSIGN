UML Class Diagram.
Overview of the software.
The functionality of the software is a basic game of play to provide entertainment and gaming on numbers. The usage of the software is for basic entertainment and can also be recommended to use as a data collection and analysis of users usage.
Probable industry you would be targeting with this software. 
The Gaming industry can have huge usage of the software prototype. The game analysis, statistics game availability logic, data storage and manipulation measure and controls have been hugely endorsed in the software to enable efficiency.
Similarly, probable recommendations to the software with respect ot modern gaming industries may allow for data collection, data mining and analysis of patterns and strategies applied by players to enable growth and development of gaming organizations and the efficiency to analyze the probable areas of investment.
UML Diagram descriptions.

UML Class Diagram.
Baring the fact that the software has inherited attributes of Object Oriented Implementations, the class diagram represents implementation of classes and the relevant attributes and variable that operate in each class. In the Player Class, the player object has the listed attributes as methods or operations that the user can implement during the game session.
In the Game Class, it contains the attributes and status of a game in the case, when a player plays the game, there are possibilities of win, lose or drawing and prior to which the player has to initiate the measure of whether to play the game by commencing it or just quite. In both instances, the game balances and points have a variation.
Game Playing Class, in the class the game is played and points are added, lost or nullified depending on the instance to which the game will be played.
UML Sequence Diagram.
In this, in brief shows the interactions between the program, player and the memory that computes different variables within the game. It shows how the data flows around the game.
UML Use Case Diagram.
The Use case basically has a player as the actor and shows all the performance or activities that the user is capable of doing.
UML Activity Diagram.
In the activity diagram, it show implementation of different task and how game activities involved in the game and the flow of logic in the step by step procedure of gaming.
What was the easiest to implement?
The easiest thing to have implemented was the software launching strategy by development of a small console layout platform that appeals the users.
 What was the most difficult? 
During the implementation, the logic flow and fragmentation of activities and connection of classes to achieve and logic flow of details and information. In the optimally best solution of solving this has enabled the development of a good UML Class diagram and the accompanying diagrams all together.
If you could go back would you do anything differently?
In the implementation and interpretation strategies, it would have been implemented in mode of object orientation whereby all classes in the UML are split in different global classes and are called by instantiation to the main class that perform all activities.
Similarly, I would have developed a Graphics User Interface that has more interaction with the user than a console platform. However upon attempting this was a complex process and ultimately we decided against it. 
 What have you learned? 
I have advanced my learning on development of UML diagrams and has helped me appreciate the use of Object Oriented Language to implement and provide solutions.
